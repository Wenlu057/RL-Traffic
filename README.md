**Adaptive Traffic Light using RL Algorithms**

Azizul Hakim | Skidmore College | Advisor: Prof. Wenlu Du

Algorithms used:
PPO
DQN
Q-Learning
Fixed Time (not an algorithm but base case)

Demands used:
Light (only cars going straight through intersection)
Ideal (cars, buses, pedestrians, turns in intersection)
Heavy (traffic jam)

Only one traffic light (id: 41896158) has been controlled using the simulation

So far *DQN* is the best model according to avg. queue length and cumulative reward
